	\section{Group Work Creating Panel 3 Presentation 11/28/2012}
	
	We spent 2.5 hours creating and going over our PowerPoint presentation. The following is a list of the key sections to our presentation: \\
	
		\subsection{PowerPoint Sections}	
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Project Description
				\item Specifications and Testing
				\item High Level Design
				\item Capture System Overview
				\item Camera selection
				\item Tripod selection
				\item Android App
				\item Analysis system design
				\item February Demos
				\item Rough Spring Schedule
				\item Budget
			\end{itemize}
			
			After constructing our PowerPoint outline we filled it in with content, assigned sections, and went our separate ways to practice.			
			
		\subsection{Practice}
			Practice for me mostly just involved rehearsing the different points I wanted to make. I must admit that I don't get too nervous about public speaking lately because I've been doing so much of it over the past two semesters. This helped a lot because it meant that I could spend much less time memorizing lines and more time ensuring i had a solid understand of the presentation flow and what general ideas i wanted to get across.

	\section{Individual Work Creating a Budget and Brainstorming for Documentation 11/18/2012}
	
	Today I created a budget for ProPANE. This was much easier than I expected because I went onto ATandT's website and found that they'd added an option to buy the camera without a data plan. Here is our budget: \\
	
		\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{images/budget.png} \\
		
		I chose the Sony VCT-R100 because it is small, compact, and durable. While there are cheaper options available I wanted the tripod to last long enough to be worth the purchase.
		I chose the 32GB microSD card because we want a memory card that is large enough to hold all of the photos taken during a lecture so that if for some reason the transfer of photos to thee analysis server fails partway through the lecture, the images won't be lost.
		The choice of the Samsung Galaxy Camera was pretty easy at this point since we've been agreed on our camera choice for months now.

	\section{Individual Work Exploring more OpenCV filters 11/15/2012}	
	
	I spent several hours experimenting with various filters to try to get a pure white background with pure black writing on the board. I found that my best results
	came when I used a combination of filters. I first converted the image to greyscale. After this i used the cv.Threshhold function on it twice to filter out imperfections in the background, and used cv.Erode to further emphasize the text. The following image was the best I was able to achieve with filters: \\
	
		\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{images/bestResult.jpg} \\
	
	As you can see there are still issues with the image, but overall it turned out quite well. The elements key to this image's successful conversion were the threshold values chosen for the cv.Threshold section. This is a key weakness for this type of image processing because it required very precise numbers and I currently don't know how to generate the right numbers automatically. Instead i had to guess and check a bit. This means that attempting to run the same code on a different image would likely result in poor image quality.

	Another success I had was in creating a program to detect the edges of a writing in a photograph. It uses a combination of the cv2.GaussianBlur filter and cv2.Canny to detect where the edges are and highlight them in white. after this i set everything else black. Inverting this creates a white image with black outlines of white text. After this i used cv.Erode in an attampt to fill in the outlines so that they looked like black text. Unfortunately, this also detracted from the image's writing clarity as the blacks tended to blur together. I'm currently looking for some method to fill in the inside of the black outlines without eroding outwards as well. The following are the three image results from the three steps: \\
		
		\includegraphics[scale=0.27]{images/cannyOriginal.jpg}
		\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{images/cannydemo.jpg} \\
		\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{images/cannydemo2.jpg}

	\section{Individual work creating a standard set of images for our image processing tests 11/12/2012}

	Creating these images actually took a lot more work than I originally expected. Not because they were difficult to photograph, but because obtaining a tripod and finding an empty room in Breakiron took work. The library was out of loaner tripods so i ended up contacting one of my bosses, who happened to know another staff member who had a tripod lying around that i could borrow.\\
	I then returned to Breakiron only to find that all the classrooms were occupied. I ended up having to leave, and came back a few hours later to take my pictures.\\
	
	My test set of photos were of the following: an image of a blank whiteboard,  an image of the whiteboard full of handwriting, and several images of me blocking different sections of the whiteboard. An interesting side effect of this endeavor is that clothing can really effect how Colin's current image processing software works. I was wearing a gray shirt with black horizontal stripes, and his software had a great deal of trouble differentiating my shirt from my actual handwriting.\\

	\section{Individual Work Researching OpenCV 11/5/2012 - 11/7/2012}
		\subsection{Installation}
			Spent a few hours installing and familiarizing myself with OpenCV-Python. It is an add-on library written in C that can be used with Python and C++.
		\subsection{Image Filtering Overview}
		There were three filters that i found to be especially useful in OpenCV.
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Laplace
				\item Erode
				\item Dilate
			\end{itemize}
		\subsection{Laplace}

			The Laplace filter basically makes all black pixels go white and all white pixels go black. This is useful because it ignores the colored pixels and gives nice readable results. \\

			\includegraphics{images/laplaceSmall.png} \\
		
		\subsection{Erode}

			Erode could be very useful because it makes writing on the whiteboards thicker and more legible. this could be useful in cases where the writing is too thin to see/easily read after other filters have been applied.\\

			Original:\\
			\includegraphics{images/originalSmall.png} \\
			Erode1:\\
			\includegraphics{images/erodeSmall1.png} \\
			Erode2:\\
			\includegraphics{images/erodeSmall2.png} \\
		
		\subsection{Dilate}
			The Dilate filter makes everything lighter, as seen below:\\

	\section{Individual Work Collecting Whiteboard images with various cameras 10/22/12}
		\subsection{Purpose}
		Today I worked to collect several images of whiteboards using different cameras. The purpose of this exercise was to gain a better understanding of what is needed from our image capture device. Analyzing the results of a range of devices we hope to better understand what the limiting factors are with indoor image capturing. \\
		\subsection{Setup}
		I captured images from two main locations: On a table in front of the whiteboard and on top of the projector. I decided to add images from near the projector just in case the table is too close to the whiteboard.
		Note that the Whiteboard was 8 feet wide for all of these images.
		
		The following images were taken 9 feet away from the whiteboard with a 3.3 Megapixel Olympus C-3040ZOOM: \\
		
		\includegraphics{images/UnmodifiedClose.jpg} \\
		\includegraphics{images/ModifiedClose.jpg} \\
		
		The following images were taken while 9 feet away from the whiteboard with the HTC Inspire's 8 Megapixel camera: 
		
		\includegraphics{images/UnmodifiedPhoneClose.jpg} \\
		\includegraphics{images/ModifiedPhoneClose.jpg} \\
		
		The following images were taken while 7.5 feet away from the whiteboard with a 12.1 Megapixel canon powershot sd1300:
		
		\includegraphics{images/TableLevelCanon.jpg} \\
		\includegraphics{images/ProjectorHeightCanon.jpg} \\
		Notice how much less glare there is from the lights when the camera is at projector height. This will make removing background noise much easier. Not only that, the highter vantage point would likely capture more of the bord and less of the professor.\\
		
		\subsection{Conclusion}
			Note that all modified images were modified using ImageJ, the open source image editor i found that uses java
			The 3.3 MP camera and my 8MP camera both required about 9 feet distance from the board minimum, while the newer canon powershot sd1300 only required about 7.5 feet distance from the board.\\
			
			Something that isn't as immediately obvious, but is more noticable when looking at the fullsize images, is the fact that the higher megapixel cameras did a better job capturing information because zooming in allowed for crisper, clearer letters. \\

	\section{Individual Work on Sourcecode 10/20/1023}
		
		\subsection{CanScanner Sourcecode}
		I viewed CamScanner's sourcecode by following the instructions on this forum: \\
		http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3593420/android-getting-source-code-from-an-apk-file\\
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Download .apk
			\item Rename remove .apk ending from name and put .zip in it's place
			\item Extract all files
			\item Download dex2jar
			\item Run dex2jar on the classes.dex file found in CamScanner's extracted files
			\item Run java decompiler on the classes.dex.dex2jar file created in step 5
			\item Save all class files
		\end{itemize}
		
		After attempting to understand CamScanner's code for 1.5 hrs, I decided that the code wasn't readable enough to use in our project. It might have useful information in it somewhere, but the decompiled naming scheme, lables, etc weren't readable enough for easy analysis. Will go back to this sourcecode if other options fail.
		
		\subsection{Alternative Program}
		
		I found an opensource program called ImageJ. This program has features similar to CamScanner's image filtering options...though they don't work as well. By adjusting the brightness and contrast of an image i was able to greatly enhance text's clarity: \\
		
		\includegraphics{images/ImageClarityWithImageJ.jpg} \\
		
		I think that this program could be useful if we decide that we want to write an image enhancement progarm in java or if we want to include some enhancement features in an android app. \\
		
		\subsection{Python Libraries}
		
		I briefly looked into different options we had in python and found two libraries that looked like they might be useful for image enhancement: \\
		
		The ImageFilter module has many pre-defined enhancement filters for the 'filter' method. \\
		http://www.pythonware.com/library/pil/handbook/introduction.htm\\
		
		Advanced enhancement features can be found in the ImageEnhance module. \\

		We met with Prof. Thompson today to discuss our risk analysis. He gave us a better understanding of what he expects from us going forward in the semester.  The goal is not to complete most every aspect of our project. Instead, he wants us to try out lots of different way to impliment various aspects of the project, and from this experimentation be able to say definitively which strategy we are going to employ and why we want to use it. \\

	\section{Group Work With Colin To Finish Up Documentation 10/10/2012}
		\noindent \emph{Electronic Whiteboards-} \\
Smartboards are full sized, touch sensitive whiteboards. You can project images onto them with a projector and then make edits/additions to them with any pointed object. The touch sensitive board senses where you are writing on the board and adds electronic corrections to the image/document. These devices do not compete as directly with our project as the smartphone apps and the scanners because they are not nearly as portable. They are the size of a standard whiteboard and thus cannot be easily moved between classrooms.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item SMART Board
                \item Panasonic's Panaboard
                \item Hitachi's Starboard
                \item The Promethean Board
            \end{itemize}
			

			\subsection{Introduction}
The following paragraphs are descriptions of several smartphone apps that contain features wish to emulate in our own project. They in many ways solve the needs of our current clients. We therefore hope to take some of these phone-app features and modify them to better meet the needs of our own clients. \\
				\subsection*{Whiteboard Capture Pro}
Source: Beetlebug Software's website\\
{\color{red} \url{http://www.beetlebugsoftware.com/}} \\
					
This is an iPhone app that takes a picture of a white board and then analyzes it for key content. The user selects objects to remove from the photograph. This leaves only the writing on the board behind. The App then analyzes the writing and removes the background image of the whiteboard itself. This sometimes leaves fuzz or imperfections in the white background, so there is then a slider available to filter out this extra noise/fuzz that shows up in the end product. The resulting image is a pure white background with handwriting on it.These photos can then be saved, cropped, shared, and organized within-app tools. \\
				\subsection*{WBConference}
Source: Elecom'e website\\
{\color{red} \url{http://app.elecom.co.jp/en/wbcap/ios/manual.html}} \\
					
This is an Android app that competes with our product because it is another whiteboard capturing device. WBConference differs from Whiteboard Capture Pro in that it is able to automatically recognize which sections of the board are whiteboard. This then allows it to apply its ìmagnified keystone correctionî to remove the excess background imagery. In cases that it cannot recognize the board you can zoom in on just the board boundaries manually before capturing the image. The app has contrast adjustment and image rotation as well so you can take images from any orientation without problems.This app has editing features as well so you can add postscripts or speech bubbles to the images. The files can then be saved as PDFs along with any notes you want to add to them.This app has a widget for the home screen for quick image capturing, and you can set up an email address for quick delivery of the images to an external source. \\
				\subsection{CamScanner -Phone PDF Creator}
Source: Intsig's Website
{\color{red} \url{http://www.intsig.com/en/camscanner.html}} \\
					
This is the most downloaded ëscannerí app on the market. With it you can take photos of any document, whiteboard, etc that you want. You then go through an editing process in which you can select the important portion of the photograph, change the detail level, contrast, light/darkness etc. It will then save your new document in any number of saved folders. You can make notes about each image and these notes will be saved with the image. You can email, print, fax, or transfer via Bluetooth any of the photos. You can also upload your images to google docs, evernote, skydrive, dropbox, or box.net. These documents get saved as PDFs. There are different enhancement modes: No enhance, low and high enhance, gray mode, and B\&W Document modes. These different modes will be better depending on the environment or object that youíre trying to scan. The B\&W mode is particularly helpful when scanning books/papers because it does a better job of removing the background noise. This app allows for batch photo taking and batch photo scanning, so you can take multiple pictures and it will scan them all at the same time. \\
				\subsection{Whiteboard Capture Pro}
Source: Magnicode's website\\
{\color{red} \url{http://www.magnicode.com/}} \\
					
This app is a dumbed down version of the previous three. It does the job, it scans and enhances images, it just isnít as well known as the others and thus doesnít have the money/time to invest in extra features. This aside, it does work, it is free, and it does save images as PDFs for later use. You can email these photos to yourself and store them in different photos. You can attach notes to your images and you can enhance the quality of the whiteboard picture with their auto-enhance tool. On the upside, it IS a much smaller program than your avg whiteboard capture app. Over all a smaller lighter free alternative. I installed this app on my phone and I had trouble using it because it kept crashing. \\

     \subsection*{Conclusion}
These smart phone apps will be some of the greatest competition to our project because they meet many of our client's needs already. Not only that, they're free applications so our clients wouldnt need to spend money either. The following is a list of features that we should attempt to emulate when designing our own product.

All of these applications contain ways to filter out background noise so that whiteboards appear pure white and text looks crisp and clean. This will be an important aspect of our own product because our image capture device will be subject to a wide variety of lighting situations and will need to be able to adapt to any of them.
Another key feature is the ability of these apps to save and send the images via email, google docs, and other online mediums. This will be an important point in our project as well.
Another good feature was the ability for some of the apps (CamScanner for example) to correct for image angles. If the board is photographed from an angle, the smartphone apps will compensate so that the final scanned image looks like it was taken straight on. \\

        \emph{Desirable features not found in smartphone apps:}
        \begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt
            \item Photo splicing: These apps do not combine images to add in details covered by professor's body.
            \item Automatic: These apps do not automatically capture images, process them, and then send them away. They instead require user feedback every step of the way.
        \end{itemize}

By adding these features to the functionality currently found in modern apps we hope to create value for our customer.


	 \subsection*{Cameras we could use in our project}
Here are the current top three cameras that we think could help us the most when building our image capturing system.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Nikon COOLPIX S800c 16 MP Digital Camera
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \url{http://www.amazon.com/Nikon-COOLPIX-Digital-Optical-3-5-inch/dp/B0090SLKUM}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Samsung Camera EK-GC100 Galaxy Camera
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \url{http://pdadb.net/index.php?m=specs&id=3813&c=samsung_ek-gc100_galaxy_camera}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Polaroid SC1630 Smart Camera
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \url{http://www.upi.com/Science_News/2012/01/16/Polaroid-joins-digital-camera-arena/UPI-61851326750025/}
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

We are interested in them because they are cameras running the Android operating system. This means that we could create our own custom application for these devices, greatly simplifying our design process. These cameras would also be useful because they can connect to Bucknell's wifi network. This would allow us to wirelessly transferr information from the cameras to whatever image processing hardware we decide to connect it to. The main drawbacks at the moment with these Android cameras is that two of them haven't been released yet (Samsung and Polaroid). IF they are released in time, they would be the most desireable of the various camera options available.

\subsection*{Details on Learning Disabilaties}
        \subsubsection*{Introduction}
One of the major motivating factors behind designing our image capturing system is to help meet the needs of students with disabilities. The term "students with disabilities" is a very broad term, however, so we would like to use the following section to help discribe some of the things that mildly disabled students have trouble with at Bucknell, and would therefore need our system to capture information presented on the board for them.
\\
Source: \\

\\
Disabilities that students might have that impair their ability to take notes:
    \begin{itemize}

This is just a small portion of the many disabilities faced by students in universities around the world. We hope to help them by giving them full access all information presented on boards during lectures. By providing easily accessible, easily modifiable images, we hope to help even the playing field for students with disabilites.
Secondary goals of our project will help to make the learning process even easier. Some students get distracted if they see more than one line of text at a time. If we have enough time we will help these students by providing slide bars that will cover portions of the images that students are not currently viewing. This and many other minor features are things that we will accomplish if we have free time after completing our primary objectives.

	\section{Individual Work on Further Research on Phone Apps 09/20/2012}
	
		\subsection{APPS}
		I was looking into android cameras earlier and found two possible candidates. One of them (The Nikon) has been released already, but the Samsung looks like a much better product if we can get it in time.
		
		Nikon COOLPIX S800c 16 MP Digital Camera\\
		Samsung Camera EK-GC100 Galaxy Camera\\
	
			
		\subsection{Whiteboard Capture Pro}
		
			This is an iPhone app that takes a picture of a white board and then analyzes it for key content. The user selects objects to remove from the photograph. This leaves only the writing on the board behind.\\
			
			The App then analyzes the writing and removes the background image of the whiteboard itself. This sometimes leaves fuzz or imperfections in the white background, so there is then a slider available to filter out this extra noise/fuzz that shows up in the end product. The resulting image is a pure white background with handwriting on it. These photos can then be saved, cropped, shared, and organized within-app tools.\\
			
			\includegraphics{images/team1.jpg}
			\includegraphics{images/team2.jpg}
			
			Notice the slider at the bottom of the image on the left. This is the contrast slider that helps remove background noise.

			(guesswork)
			Contrast sliders work by analyzing the transition colors between the white and the eventual blue of the writing. The higher the contrast, the faster the transition must be between pure white and pure blue. If the transition is too slow, the transition pixels are assumed to be noise and removed from the photo. This is useful both in making the handwriting appear crisp and in removing random background smudges. Smudges are of course removed because they don’t have the crisp transition periods found in the writing on the board.
			(Now back to research)
			
		\subsection{WBConference}
			This is an Android app that competes with our product because it is another whiteboard capturing device. WBConference differs from Whiteboard Capture Pro in that it is able to automatically recognize which sections of the board are whiteboard. This then allows it to apply its “magnified keystone correction” to remove the excess background imagery. In cases that it cannot recognize the board you can zoom in on just the board boundaries manually before capturing the image. The app has contrast adjustment and image rotation as well so you can take images from any orientation without problems.\\
			
			This app has editing features as well so you can add postscripts or speech bubbles to the images. The files can then be saved as PDFs along with any notes you want to add to them. This app has a widget for the home screen for quick image capturing, and you can set up an email address for quick delivery of the images to an external source.\\

		\subsection{CamScanner -Phone PDF Creator}
			This is the most downloaded 'scanner' app on the market.\\
			
			With it you can take photos of any document, whiteboard, etc that you want. You then go through an editing process in which you can select the important portion of the photograph, change the detail level, contrast, light/darkness etc. It will then save your new document in any number of saved folders. You can make notes about each image and these notes will be saved with the image. You can email, print, fax, or transfer via Bluetooth any of the photos. You can also upload your images to google docs, evernote, skydrive, dropbox, or box.net. \\
			
			These documents get saved as PDFs.\\
			
			There are different enhancement modes: No enhance, low and high enhance, gray mode, and BandW Document modes. These different modes will be better depending on the environment or object that you’re trying to scan. The BandW mode is particularly helpful when scanning books/papers because it does a better job of removing the background noise. \\
			
			CamScanner allows for batch photo taking and batch photo scanning, so you can take multiple pictures and it will scan them all at the same time.\\
			
			You can password protect your documents and even save different document sizes.\\
			\includegraphics{images/autoCrop.jpg}	

		\subsection{Whiteboard Snap}
		
		This app is a dumbed down version of the previous three. It does the job, it scans and enhances images, it just isn’t as well known as the others and thus doesn’t have the money/time to invest in extra features.\\
		
		This aside, it does work, it is free, and it does save images as PDFs for later use. You can email these photos to yourself and store them in different photos. You can attach notes to your images and you can enhance the quality of the whiteboard picture with their auto-enhance tool.\\
		On the upside, it IS a much smaller program than your avg whiteboard capture app. Over all a smaller lighter free alternative.\\
		I installed this app on my phone and I had trouble using it because it kept crashing.\\

		\subsection{Further Research}
			Found a page that seems to have a piece of demo software available to those with access to Microsoft Research’s internal website:\\
			http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/zhang/WhiteboardIt/\\
			This system takes an image and filters out key information.
			
			The software and technology as a whole is still in its research/development stages. It is a joint project with MS Research and MS Hardware called Distributed Meetings. They have a few technologies going together: A 360 degree video and audio recorder, a Whiteboard image capturing system, (most relevant to us) a PC graphics capture system. Their idea is to record the meeting in several different ways, and then provide easily accessible ways to view all meeting content.

	\section{09/11/2012}
		I first uploaded pictures to the website for our personal biographies.
		\\
		\includegraphics{images/Griffin.jpg}
		\includegraphics{images/Colin.jpg}
		\includegraphics{images/Phil.jpg}
		\\
					After this I wrote an overview about ProPANE on our front page:\\
			Welcome to the website for the Electrical and Computer Engineering senior design project led by Griffin Dunn, Phil Stahlfeld, and Colin Madigan.
			ProPANE's goal is to design and implement a system that will automatically capture all information written on a board during class. This system will then present the saved information in a readily accessible manner so that Bucknell can both better meet the needs of students with disabilities and provide professors with a means to easily compare their notes with the actual information presented in a lecture.
			This project was motivated by Bucknell’s desire to cheaply meet the needs of their students with disabilities. Hiring professional note takers is an expensive endeavor and finding cheaper alternatives is much more desirable.
			This project involves the capture of information from a 2D surface. It will likely require image capture and image processing technology.
		\subsection{Design Constraints}
			\begin{itemize}			
				\item ProPANE must be fully autonomous. After setup the system should require little to no outside interference. The professor should be able to turn it on and leave it running during class and afterwards return to find a set of images depicting everything that was on the board during class.
				\item The information must be presented in a format that allows for easy manipulation, zooming, and editing so that students with disabilities can easily view all content that is displayed on the board.
				\item The system must be discreet. It cannot make loud noises, flashes of light, or create any other forms of distraction during class. Students must be able to concentrate on the lecture not the board capture device.
			\end{itemize}

	\section{Individual Work on Competing Technologies 09/05/2012}
		We have three technologies to compete with: 
		
		\subsection{The Phone App}
			There are several smartphone apps out there that will scan pictures of white boards and filter out the unnecessary information. These applications range from free to a couple dollars on most app stores.\\
				http://www.beetlebugsoftware.com/ is a good example. \\

				Other notable apps:
					\begin{itemize}
						\item Qipit White
						\item Genius Scan
						\item JotNot Scanner Pro
						\item Whiteboard Capture Pro
					\end{itemize}

			However, this IS an issue because it is an area that could possibly pose legal problems. If the resolution is too poor, then the system would be giving ProPANE reliant students a disadvantage. In my opinion, that would be a complete failure of the project.\\
			
		\subsection{Scanners}
			There are scanners that you can attach to an existing white board. After calibrating these scanners, they track your movements using the combination of the sanner and an electronic pen. These electronic pens have replaceable dry erase tips to draw with and replaceable batteries to keep them charged. Some of them require a projector to display background information and others do not.\\

			Examples:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item MimoCapture
					\item eBeam System 3
					\item Interlink FreeBeam
				\end{itemize}

			
		\subsubsection{Electronic Whiteboards}
			Electronic whiteboards are special boards that sense pressure and can display electronic pen interactions with a high degree of accuracy. These displays come in two standard varieties: Those that are electronic displays and those that require a projector to project both the images and any user-inputted writing. Electronic whiteboards tend to be the easiest to use, but they're not very portable because the entire board is required. The trade-off for poor portability is that they can do much more. Multiple people can interact with the board at the same time, and it can be a much more interactive experience. \\

			Examples:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Smarttech’s SMARTboard 
				\item Panasonic’s Panaboard 
				\item Hitachi’s Starboard 
				\item The Promethean board 
			\end{itemize}

	\section{Initial Group Meeting 08/30/2012}
			\emph{With Phil Stahlfeld and Colin Madigan}\\
			
			Began working on group tasks:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Team Name
				\item Team Logo
				\item Document Template
				\item Design Specifications
			\end{itemize}
			
		\subsection{Team Name}
			After some discussion we decided that names such as ‘White board scanner’ and ‘board capture system’ weren’t catchy enough. We decided to create an acronym instead so to make our name catchier and thus more memorable. Colin finally came up with our final acronym: ProPANE, short for Professional Portable Automatic Note Extractor. With this agreed upon we moved on to deciding upon our team logo. \\

		\subsection{Team Logo}
			We decided that our logo had to relate to our team name, so with that in mind we searched for images related to the molecular structure of propane. Our favorite image is shown below, and has been adopted as our team logo:\\
			\includegraphics{images/logo.jpeg}\\

		\subsection{Document Template}
			We decided to use LaTEX as our default layout manager for all of our documents. We chose this formatter because it takes care of all the formatting and leaves us with the job of finding and preparing the information, which is the more important part of our job. 

		\subsection{Technical Specifications}
			As noted in our first deliverable, “The goal of this project is to create a system that captures all of the information written on a board during a class in a readily accessible manner. The two driving forces behind solving this problem are: autonomous collection of notes for students with disabilities and providing a means for professors to compare their notes with the actual information presented during a lecture.” \\

			We will be meeting with Robert Midkiff and Douglas Gabauer on 09/13/2013 to discuss more detailed specifications for the project.\\
