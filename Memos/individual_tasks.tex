\noindent
The purpose of this memo is to assign the tasks for the remainder of the semester to individual members of the group. The purpose of dividing up tasks is to assign individual responsibility for each task as well as to insure that time is not being wasted by two members of the team working on identical tasks. This is by no means a complete list of tasks for the remainder of the semester, but it should be complete enough for the next 10 days. Please note that these tasks are in addition to the group tasks such as preparing for upcoming panels.
